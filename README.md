I care about writing clean, readable code and building things that actually work in real-world scenarios.

- Mostly working with backend and full-stack web development  
- Learning more about distributed systems, cloud, and system design  
- Comfortable with JavaScript, Node.js, FastAPI, Docker, and AWS
